This is a DLL that can add a drag n drop feature to your applications, you'll be able to drag files from explorer to your applications. Its very simple and easy to use. It uses subclassing to capture the WM_DROPFILES message and all that is done in a class. You can drag enable any common controls like treeview, listview, edit boxes etc, or you can make your MDI app drag enable too.Besure to read the ReadMe file included in the zip file for explanation of whats going on in the component.
